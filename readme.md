# Data

In order to run the R code, you need to have the expected data included in the project. You should create a top-level "data" directory that contains all of the 4 CSV files you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odjh6_URj1K8rUjA6yI06YoV7yLSN79e?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto) inside of the "reduced_with_degree_metrics.zip" folder. The code that was used to generate these files can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/Chad-Glazier/webgraph-reduction).
