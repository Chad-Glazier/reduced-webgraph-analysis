# Data

In order to run the R code, you need to have the expected data included in the project. There should be a top-level `data` directory that contains all of the 8 CSV files you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odjh6_URj1K8rUjA6yI06YoV7yLSN79e?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto). The code used to generate these files can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/Chad-Glazier/webgraph-reduction).
