# Data

In order to run the R code, you need to have the expected data included in the project. You should create a top-level "data" directory that contains all of the CSV files you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1odjh6_URj1K8rUjA6yI06YoV7yLSN79e?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto). The code that was used to generate these files can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/Chad-Glazier/webgraph-reduction).

Once those files are downloaded, and inside of the correct repository, you can run the various `research_question_*` files from the `src/` directory. Each one contains the code that was used to answer the corresponding research question in our accompanying [paper](./Structural%20Changes%20in%20the%20Web%20from%202018-2024.pdf).

The `src/dependencies.R` file lists the R libraries that this project depends on, you can run it to install them all at once.
